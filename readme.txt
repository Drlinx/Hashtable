Assignment: Hash tables

    This Assignment is a working program of a hash table. It allows you to
Add or remove elements at will as well as import an entire files contents.

    I didn't have as many difficulties coding this as I thought I would for
example during the entire process of this there are no bugs that can cause 
the program to crash. The bugs currently are all logic errors. The largest bug 
I had was during the radix the original key value was not assigned to zero
however because we were using the unassigned value we added that to the key 
which produced what felt like randomly generated key values.
